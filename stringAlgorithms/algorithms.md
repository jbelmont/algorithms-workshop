## RabinKarp

[Rabin-Karp Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)

> In computer science, the Rabin–Karp algorithm or Karp–Rabin algorithm is a string-searching algorithm created by Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin (1987) that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It uses a rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining positions. Generalizations of the same idea can be used to find more than one match of a single pattern, or to find matches for more than one pattern.

```
function RabinKarp(string s[1..n], string pattern[1..m])
    hpattern := hash(pattern[1..m]);
    for i from 1 to n-m+1
        hs := hash(s[i..i+m-1])
        if hs = hpattern
            if s[i..i+m-1] = pattern[1..m]
                return i
    return not found
```

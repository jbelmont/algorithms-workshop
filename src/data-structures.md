## Definition of a Data Structure

[Data Structure (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Types of Data Structures

#### Linear Data Structures

A data structure is linear if its elements form a sequence:

* Lists
* Sets
* Tuples
* Queues
* Stacks

## NonLinear Data Structures

A data structure is non-linear when an element is connected to many other elements

* Trees
* Tables
* Hash
* Containers

## Set Operations

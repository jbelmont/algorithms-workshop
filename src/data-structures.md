## Definition of a Data Structure

[Data Structure (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

> In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Types of Data Structures

#### Linear Data Structures

A data structure is linear if its elements form a sequence:

* Lists
* Sets
* Tuples
* Queues
* Stacks

## NonLinear Data Structures

A data structure is non-linear when an element is connected to many other elements

* Trees
* Tables
* Hash
* Containers

## Set Operations

[Set (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28abstract_data_type%29)

> In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

#### Union 

The union of s and t returns all the elements of set s and set t

#### Intersection

The intersection of s and t return the all the elements that belong to A and to B

#### Add

Add is a method that adds an element to the set

#### Remove

Remove is a method that removes an element from the set

## Stack Operations

[Stack (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29)

> In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
>     push, which adds an element to the collection, and
>     pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

#### Push 

Add an element to the stack

#### Pop 

Remove most recent element from the stack and return it.

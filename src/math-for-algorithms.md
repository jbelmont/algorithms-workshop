## Summations

[Summation (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation)

> In mathematics, summation is the addition of a sequence of any kind of numbers, called addends or summands; the result is their sum or total. Beside numbers, other types of values can be summed as well: functions, vectors, matrices, polynomials and, in general, elements of any type of mathematical objects on which an operation denoted "+" is defined.

## Sets

[Set (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_%28mathematics%29)

> In mathematics, a set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The arrangement of the objects in the set does not matter. A set may be denoted by placing its objects between a pair of curly braces. For example, the numbers 2, 4, and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately; when considered collectively, they form a single set of size three, written as {2, 4, 6}, which could also be written as {2, 6, 4}, {4, 2, 6}, {4, 6, 2}, {6, 2, 4} or {6, 4, 2}.

## Graphs

[Graphs (discrete mathematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29)

> In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.

## Counting

[Counting (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting)

> Counting is the process of determining the number of elements of a finite set of objects. The traditional way of counting consists of continually increasing a (mental or spoken) counter by a unit for every element of the set, in some order, while marking (or displacing) those elements to avoid visiting the same element more than once, until no unmarked elements are left; if the counter was set to one after the first object, the value after visiting the final object gives the desired number of elements. The related term enumeration refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite (combinatorial) set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element.

## Probability

[Probability (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability)

> Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes ("heads" and "tails") are both equally probable; the probability of "heads" equals the probability of "tails"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either "heads" or "tails" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).

## Matrices

[Matrices (Wikipedia Definition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics))

> In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table (see irregular matrix) of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. For example, the dimension of the matrix below is 2 Ã— 3 (read "two by three"), because there are two rows and three columns:

\\[
\begin{equation*}
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 9 & -13
\\\20 & 5 & -6
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
\\]

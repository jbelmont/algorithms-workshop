## Implement the Bubble Sort Algorithm

#### Description of the Algorithm

[Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)

> Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to insertion sort. Bubble sort can be practical if the input is in mostly sorted order with some out-of-order elements nearly in position.

> Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of О(n2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Most practical sorting algorithms have substantially better worst-case or average complexity, often O(n log n). Even other О(n2) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, generally run faster than bubble sort, and are no more complex. Therefore, bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm.

```
procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )
    n = length(A)
    repeat
        newn = 0
        for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do
            if A[i] > A[i+1] then
                swap(A[i], A[i+1])
                newn = i
            end if
        end for
        n = newn
    until n <= 1
end procedure
```
